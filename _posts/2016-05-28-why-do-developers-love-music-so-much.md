> There are a million ways to lose a work day, but not even a single way to get one back - Peopleware

I used to like open office floor plans until I had to work in one. On my first day of work at a company with an open office plan, I walked through a sea of conjoined desks to my spot and noticed on the way that over three quarters of the staff in the section had their headphones on. I thought to myself that these guys must love their music. But it soon dawned upon me just how **noisy the office was and the poor souls with their headphones on were making hopeless attempts to get in the zone to do their work**. Not long after, I was reaching into my laptop bag trying to look for my headphones and at the same time trying to find some music on the Youtube to block out the noise.

At Starscriber, I had a semi-private office that I shared with a senior developer. The outside area had enough room for 4 or 5 developers. A third office was left vacant in case someone needed complete privacy but was hardly ever used. The Operations and the I.T. staff sat in a different section that was separated from the engineering offices by a corridor and couple of doors. The engineering offices were generally very quiet and distractions to developers were kept to a minimum. The office layout looked like this:

It was perfect (except that the windows didn't have much of a view). We had just the right balance of space and the number of people using it. Going back to open office floor plans, **I think that the problem is not so much with the concept, but with the density of people crammed into a small space**. With so many people, there will be many visual and audible distractions like phone calls, conversations, skype calls, FedEx delivery guys walking around etc. This makes it impossible for developers to focus especially when they are trying to concentrate on a hard problem. Symptoms of such environment include developers going to work in quiet corners of the office like the kitchen after the lunch hours or 'working from home' in order to finish their projects on time.

At Starscriber, I cannot recall ever seeing developers using headphones to listen to music. I'm not saying that listening to music is bad - I listen to music myself when I'm doing some trivial task like writing a report or when I'm trying to relax. Nothing wrong with it. I have an issue when developers **must use music in order to concentrate on their work**. In the [Peopleware](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932633439/) chapter "Bring Back the Door", there's a section on an interesting study conducted at the Cornell University on the effects of listening to music while performing programming tasks:

> During the 1960s, researchers at Cornell University **conducted a series of tests on the effects of working with music**. They polled a group of computer science students and divided the students into two groups, those who liked to have music in the background while they worked (studied) and those who did not. Then they put half of each group together in a silent room, and the other half of each group in a different room equipped with  earphones and a musical selection. Participants in both rooms were given a Fortran programming problem to work out from specification. **To no one's surprise, participants in the two rooms performed about the same in speed and accuracy of programming** [...]
>
**The Cornell experiment, however, contained a hidden wild card**. The specification required that an output data stream be formed through a series of manipulations on numbers in the input data stream. For example, participants had to shift each number two digits to the left and then divide by one hundred and so on, perhaps
completing a dozen operations in total. **Although the specification never said it, the net effect of all the operations was that each output number was necessarily equal to its input number. Some people realized this and others did not. Of those who figured it out, the overwhelming majority came from the quiet room**.

Many of the everyday tasks performed by professional workers are done in the serial processing center of the left brain. Music will not interfere particularly with this work, since it's the brain's holistic right side that digests music. But not all of the work is centered in the left brain. There is that occasional breakthrough that makes you say "Ahah!" and steers you toward an ingenious bypass that may save months or years of work. The creative leap involves right-brain function. **If the right brain, is busy listening to 1001 Strings on Muzak, the opportunity for a creative leap is lost**.

Great points.

Taking an action to change the working environment isn't always easy. I have won a few and lost many battles on this front as sometimes managers or higher-ups feel that this is beyond their control or is useless. This "Policy of Default" is illustrated in Peopleware:

> A California company that I consult for is very much concerned about being responsive to its people. Last
year, the company's management conducted a survey in which all programmers (more than a thousand) were asked to list the best and the worst aspects of their jobs. The manager who ran the survey was very excited
about the changes the company had undertaken. He told me that the number two problem was poor communication
with upper management. Having learned that from the survey, the company set up quality circles, gripe sessions, and other communication programs. I listened politely as he described them in detail. When he was done, I asked **what the number one problem was. "The environment," he replied. "People were upset about the noise." I asked what steps the company had taken to remedy that problem. "Oh, we couldn't do anything about that," he said.
"That's outside our control**."

Except noise and interruptions, I have no other beef with open office floor plans. It's the noise that distracts and brings productivity down. And it is impossible to keep the noise down in open office floor plans where many disjoint teams are crammed together. Prefer private or semi-private offices for developers and provide a distraction-free environment for them to exercise their creativity.
