[htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/) is an interactive process monitor. It's one of my favorite linux tools that I use regularly to monitor system resources. If you take [top](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html) and put it on steroids, you get htop.

htop has an awesome visual interface that you can also interact with using your keyboard. The screen packs a lot of information which can be daunting to look at. I tried to find a nice infographic to explain what each number, value or color coded bars mean, but couldn't find any. Hence I decided to make one myself over the Christmas break.

Here's what htop looks like when you first run it. (Image courtesy of [Joe Collins](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTfabOKD7Yty6sDF4POBVqA)):

I've **separated the interface into upper and lower sections so I have enough room to annotate**.

Let's start with the **upper section**.

Here's the **lower section** of htop.

I hope you found this post useful. Until next time.
