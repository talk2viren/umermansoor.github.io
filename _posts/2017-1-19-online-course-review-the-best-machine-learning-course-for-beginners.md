title: Online Course Review - the Best Machine Learning Course for Beginners

In school, I enrolled and took a couple of AI and machine learning courses: neural networks and image recognition come to mind. But at the time, I wasn't at all interested in the dry mathematics and statistical equations that professors preached. A couple of years ago, I started seeing articles and blogs on self-driving cars. It didn't change my mind - I still wasn't sure what all the hype was all about. That was about to change.

One evening by chance, I came across a link to a what sounded like a [Mario video](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9713802). Being a sucker for retro video games, I clicked on it. The video shows a skilled player playing Super Mario World. Here's the twist: **the skilled player isn't human**. It is a machine learning program that taught itself how to play Super Mario World with zero help. When it started, it knew absolutely nothing about Super Mario World or Super Nintendo. It didn't even know that pressing the A key on the controller makes Mario jump over obstacles. **It learned to play and complete the first level all by itself... by applying machine learning**.

Mind = Blown.

I wish my professors had shown something similar at the beginning of the course. I would have been all over it. It was a fantastic demonstration of the power of machine learning. I spent my weekend reading blogs and news articles about machine learning applications. I tried to run some simple applications but didn't get far. I wanted to understand what problems it can solve. I wanted to apply it to a real-world problem.

At some point, I decided that I need to take a course so I could read and understand machine learning blogs and research papers. I researched online found [a course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) offered by [Andrew Ng](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg). For those of you who don't know who Andrew is, he is a highly respected and a very influential scientist in the fields of machine learning and AI. He's leading machine learning efforts at Google and Baidu. Before that, he taught at Stanford as an associate professor.

I enrolled in **[Andrew's course on Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)** and I'm super glad I did. If I have to rate Andrew's course out of 5 stars, **I would give it 5 stars**. It was literally one of *the* best learning experiences of my life. I had fun throughout and learned many useful concepts many of which I was able to apply to solve real-world problems.

* The course itself is 11 weeks. I spent 3-4 hours a week. If you have more time, you can definitely finish it sooner.
* The course is designed for **complete beginners** to machine learning. You don't need any prior experience with machine learning tools and libraries.
* Andrew Ng has an amazing teaching style. It's super fun and very engaging. He clearly articulates complex algorithms and mathematical equations which make it very easy to grasp the subject matter.
* The course will **introduce you to various flavors of machine learning algorithms**: [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), (artificial) [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine), [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). By covering many different algorithms, it lays the groundwork and sets up the foundation to continue learning in the areas that interest you.
* **Programming assignments focus on solving real-world problems**: handwritten digit recognition using neural networks and spam classification with support vector machines (SVM) were my favorites.
* A couple of friends who took the course **complained** about one aspect: *the assignments are to be done in MATLAB or Octave*. They were hoping they'd be able to use their favorite language and learn a machine learning library like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). However, I feel MATLAB/Octave is a great choice for this course. It forces you to think about applying machine learning algorithms using matrices and matrix operations, without getting caught in nuances of a high level language or a library. I would however strongly recommend that you **do not skip the tutorial sections covering MATLAB/Octave** and pay very close attention to them. Review the tutorial sections twice if you need to, or you'll spend a lot of time *stuck* on assignments.

If you are interested in machine learning, you should be, and you are a beginner or know very little about machine learning, [Andrew's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is the best investment of your time that you can make. The only regret you'd have is that you didn't enroll sooner :)

Happy machine learning.
