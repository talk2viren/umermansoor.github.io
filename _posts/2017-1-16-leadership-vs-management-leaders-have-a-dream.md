It's a beautiful winter day in San Francisco and also the *long weekend*. Today is the Martin Luther King Jr. Day - a holiday to celebrate the life and legacy of a great leader who fought for human rights for everyone. Dr. King *challenged the status quo to bring about tremendous change*. He transformed the american society and the human race in general. Great leaders are **immensely effective at rallying people to work towards attaining a goal**. A goal that is not trivial, or without any risks, that anyone can imagine or dare to follow. **Leaders imagine a world that's radically different from their present**. *Dr. King, Henry Ford, Jeff Bezos, Aaron Swartz* all imagined a world that was very different from the one that they lived in.

Any organization that wants to survive and thrive, needs '*effective*' leaders. But not all leaders are created equal. To highlight the differences, [John C. Maxwell](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Leadership-Proven-Maximize-Potential/dp/1619692155) created a hierarchy of various **levels of leadership**:

Most organizations put managers in leadership roles. They are at the lowest in the Maxwell's 5 levels. **Managers are tasked with getting people to do something**. Managers receive their tasks from their bosses and their job is get their reports to achieve the targets. Why do employees listen to their managers? The answer is simple: *because they have to*. Managers have certain powers that come with their position. People listen to their manager because there is a carrot or a threat: a promotion, a bonus, fear of being fired from their job or demoted and rarely, some inspiration. Management is about **getting people to comply**.

Managers have a **plan** to achieve a specific target. *'Frank will design, Joe will implement and Larry will do the Q/A in order to get the release of XYZ out in the second quarter'*. These plans are often not clear and boring if they are not backed by a clear vision. Leaders have a long term vision. [A dream](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm) of a future that motivates people. Great leaders are very effective at clearly articulating their vision and rallying people to the cause.

At some stage, both leaders and managers need people to carry the mission forward or to achieve a target. **Managers create [circles of power](https://hbr.org/2013/08/tests-of-a-leadership-transiti) and have subordinates who comply. Leaders create circles of influence**. Leaders have followers who enroll **voluntarily**. Managers are process oriented and subject everyone to the same process. **Leaders focus on people. They understand that people are their most important asset**. Enrolling the right people is a very difficult task. **Great Leaders are extremely good at identifying the right people. They have a great intuition and judgement about people**. Once they enroll the right people, they trust them with getting the task done, empower them and ["get out of their way"](http://avc.com/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky/):

> For every Steve Jobs, there are a thousand leaders who learned to hire smart people and let them build great things in a nurturing environment of empowerment and it was AWESOME. That doesn’t mean lowering your standards. It doesn’t mean letting people do bad work. **It means hiring smart people who get things done—and then getting the hell out of the way**.

Does this mean managers are useless or not needed? The answer is '*no*' and partly because leaders don't grow on trees. Organizations need managers, as much as they need leaders. A McDonald's restaurant will have teenagers goofing around if it didn't have managers. Most projects will fail if they don't have managers. However, it takes a leader with a compelling vision to motivate like-minded people to follow a bold goal.

Happy Martin Luther King Day.
