Today is the Martin Luther King Day. It's a beautiful winter day in San Francisco and also the long weekend. Dr. King was a great leader who ensured human rights for everyone. Dr. King challenged the status quo to bring about a change. He transformed the american society and the human race in general. Great leaders are tremendously effective at rallying people to work towards attaining a goal. A goal that is not trivial, or without any risks that anyone can imagine or dare to follow. Leaders imagine a world that's radically different from the present. Dr. King, Henry Ford, Jeff Bezos, Aaron Swartz all imagined a world that was very different from the one that they lived in.

Any organization that wants to survive and thrive, needs '*effective*' leaders. But not all leaders are created equal. To highlight the differences, [John C. Maxwell](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Leadership-Proven-Maximize-Potential/dp/1619692155) created a hierarchy of various levels of leadership:

Most organizations put managers in leadership roles. They are at the lowest in the Maxwell's 5 levels. **Managers are tasked with getting people to do something**. Managers receive their tasks from their bosses and their job is get their reports to achieve the targets. Why do employees listen to their managers? The answer is simple: *because they have to*. Managers have certain powers that come with their position. People listen to their manager because there is a carrot or a threat: a promotion, a bonus fear of being fired from the job or demoted and rarely, some inspiration. Management is about getting people to comply.

Managers have a plan on what steps need to be taken to achieve a goal. *Frank will design, Joe will implement and Larry will do the Q/A*. Leaders have a long term vision. [A dream](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm) so to speak. **Managers create [circles of power](https://hbr.org/2013/08/tests-of-a-leadership-transiti) and subordinates who comply. Leaders create circles of influence and followers who enroll voluntarily**. Managers are very risk-averse. **Leaders are all about change**. Managers are focused on processes and methodologies. They want everyone to follow the same process. **Leaders focus on people. They understand that people are their most important asset**. Enrolling the right people is a very difficult task. Dr. King didn't gain millions of followers on the first day. Leaders need smart people who believe in the mission and the cause. Once they hire the right people, they trust them with getting the task done, empower them and  ["get out of their way"](http://avc.com/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky/):

> For every Steve Jobs, there are a thousand leaders who learned to hire smart people and let them build great things in a nurturing environment of empowerment and it was AWESOME. That doesn’t mean lowering your standards. It doesn’t mean letting people do bad work. **It means hiring smart people who get things done—and then getting the hell out of the way**.

Does this mean managers are bad or not needed? May be not. Organizations need managers, as much as they need leaders. A McDonald's restaurant will have teenagers goofing around if it didn't have managers. Most projects will fail if they don't have managers. However, it takes a leader with a compelling vision to motivate like-minded people to follow some ambitious goal. 

Happy Martin Luther King Day.
