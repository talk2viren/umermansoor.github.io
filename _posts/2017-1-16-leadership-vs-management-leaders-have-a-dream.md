Today is the Martin Luther King Jr. Day - a holiday to celebrate the life and legacy of a great [Civil Rights Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement) leader. [Dr. King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.) was an incredibly effective leader who *challenged the status quo* and transformed the American society forever. He had a [dream](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm) and he got people to rally behind him to make it a reality. And that's what great leaders do. *Dr. King, Gandhi, Henry Ford, Jeff Bezos,* all had **vision** of a world that was very different from the one they lived in and they were able to **inspire people** to work towards making their vision a reality.

Any organization that wants to survive and thrive, needs leaders. But not all leaders are created equal. Some are much more effective than the others. To highlight the differences in leadership effectiveness, [John C. Maxwell](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Leadership-Proven-Maximize-Potential/dp/1619692155) created a hierarchy called **levels of leadership**:

Let's talk about **managers** because they are put in charge of people and teams. Most managers that people come across are at the lowest level in Maxwell's hierarchy. **Managers are tasked with getting people to do something**. Their job is to get their direct reports to achieve targets - targets that they themselves have received from their bosses. Why do employees listen to their managers? The answer is simple: *because they have to*. Managers have certain powers that come with their position. Employees listen to their managers because there is a carrot or a threat: a promotion, a bonus, fear of being fired from their job or demoted. Management is about getting people to **comply**.

Most managers are boring and uninspiring. They have very specific plans and **religiously follow processes** and standards. They think that some process or a famous software development methodology will help them achieve their goals. They think that people are replaceable and don't care so much about them or the team culture. As a result, spirits dampen, culture suffers and people either mentally check out or silently comply even if it makes zero sense. If there is one thing I have learned managing different teams, it is that **culture defeats everything**. Strategy, best laid out plans, super smart team, the grandest world vision, you name it, all succumb to culture (or the lack of it.)

Leaders (including effective managers) deeply believe that people are their most important asset... smart people who share the same vision. Unlike managers, leaders have **followers who enroll voluntarily**. They don't follow the leader because they have to; they follow because they want to. **Great leaders are extremely good at identifying the right people**, who don't need to be babysit or micromanaged to get something done. Great leaders hire the right people, *trust* them with getting the task done, *empower* them and ["get the hell of out of their way"](http://avc.com/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky/):

> ... there are a thousand leaders who learned to hire smart people and let them build great things in a nurturing environment of empowerment and it was AWESOME. That doesn’t mean lowering your standards. **It doesn’t mean letting people do bad work. It means hiring smart people who get things done—and then getting the hell out of the way**.

That's it. Hope you enjoyed this post and learned a thing or two. If you have any comments, please leave them in the comments section below.

Happy Martin Luther King Day.
