The goal of SPDY is to reduce web page load time. SPDY does not replace HTTP; it modifies the way HTTP requests and responses are sent over the wire.[1] This means that all existing server-side applications can be used without modification if a SPDY-compatible translation layer is put in place.

Turn-on HTTP/2 today!

HTTP/2[1] is real and available today with Akamai. The standard was approved February 2015, and most of the leading browsers already support it. Akamai customers can enable it right now with a few clicks without requiring any changes on the origin infrastructure.

SPDY or HTTP/2 but not both: http://blog.chromium.org/2015/02/hello-http2-goodbye-spdy-http-is_9.html
