> I have not failed. I have just found 10,000 ways that won't work. -Thomas Edison

Software development is an activity that requires serious brain power. And it's natural that software developers make mistakes. However, many organizations and managers stigmatize failures. It's considered a sin to make an error on the job. A sin that is not going to be forgotten any time soon.

Mistakes are a part of creative and innovative culture. In his autobiography, [Against the Odds](http://www.amazon.com/Against-Odds-Autobiography-Business-Icons/dp/1587990148), James Dyson writes:

> I made 5127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5126 failures. But I learned from each one. That’s how I came up with a solution. So I don’t mind failure. I’ve always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they’ve had. **The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative…
We’re taught to do things the right way. But if you want to discover something that other people haven’t, you need to do things the wrong way**.

I couldn't agree more.

The fear most managers have is that mistakes will cost their company money. It's true. But the fact is that people will make mistakes in any activity that requires thinking and creativity. So employees will make mistakes no matter what managers do. [DeMarco and Lister](http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Second-Edition/dp/0932633439) explained it better:

> Fostering an atmosphere that doesn't allow for error simply
makes people defensive. They don't try things that may turn out
badly. You encourage this defensiveness when you try to systematize
the process, when you impose rigid methodologies so that staff
members are not allowed to make any of the key strategic decisions
lest they make them incorrectly. The average level of technology
may be modestly improved by any steps you take to inhibit error.
**The team sociology, however, can suffer grievously**.

Read the last sentence again. *The team sociology, however, ~~can~~ will suffer grievously*. As a software manager, your primary day job is to make it possible for your team to do work. When people become defensive, they lose motivation to do good work. Whenever a 'bug' is reported by customer or a client, instead of focusing their efforts to objectively locate the bug, employees spend time and energy on 'covering their asses' and collecting data to 'prove' that there has to be something "wrong with the other system".

Another common fear managers have is that by allowing mistakes, people will make 'stupid' mistakes. I guess I have have been lucky to have managed very few 'bad apples'. (I could only think of 2 bad employees in the last 4 years - they were let go). Majority of software developers are smart, talented and proud people who value quality work, learning and professional development.

I made a mistake in 2012 that cost my company as much as $5,000: a few 'billable' user events were lost due to a Redis library issue. I was a fairly new software developer and had convinced my bosses to let me replace the old MySQL database with the shinny new Redis. I fixed the bug after 3 sleepless nights and was devastated. I was very angry at myself for screwing up. But My boss shrugged it off, thanked me sincerely for fixing the problem and recognized my efforts publicly. Quoting someone, he said to me: "*If you're not making mistakes, then you're not trying anything new.*"

Mistakes should be embraced and celebrated. Software development is a difficult activity and software developers will make mistakes. They shouldn't be crucified for making *honest* mistakes. It's part of the learning. Good managers don't cheat their employees of personal growth and development opportunities.
