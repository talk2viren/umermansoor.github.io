Hi there. I’m Umer Mansoor, the author of this blog and your host. I'm a software developer in San Francisco. I love writing software and coincidentally been managing software teams for the past few years. I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeahoy) and my email is: umermk3-*at*-gmail-*dot*-com.

**A little background about me:** My first full-time job after graduating in 2011 was at a [startup](http://www.starscriber.com) where I learned a lot of other things besides software development: building teams, motivating people and a little bit about sales and marketing. I learned that *passionate people could achieve anything they set their minds on*. Building products should be fun. And we had a blast building several products for millions of users – that are still in production.

**DISCLAIMER:** The views and opinions expressed on this websites are solely my own. They do not express the views or opinions of my employer. Also, *most of the time, I don't even have faintest idea what I'm rambling about*.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to post a comment or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeahoy).

Thanks for reading!
