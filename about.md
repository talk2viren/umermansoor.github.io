Hi there. I’m Umer Mansoor, the author of this blog and your host. Building great software and teams is my passion.
</p>

**A little background about me:** I have been working with startups and constructing software since 2005. My first full-time job after graduating in 2011 was at a [startup](http://www.starscriber.com) where I learned a lot of other things besides software development: building teams, motivating teams and a little bit about sales and marketing. Most importantly, I learned that *passionate people could achieve anything they set their minds on*. Building products should be fun. And we had a blast building several products for millions of users – that are still in production.

I live in the [Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda,_California) and work in San Francisco, California. And loving it all… the weather, the food and the diversity.
